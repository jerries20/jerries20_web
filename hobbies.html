			 <h1> MY TOP 3 HOBBIES</h1>
			 
			 <h2> Basketball </h2>
			 <p class="serif">In the Phillipines Basketball is really popular. My brother and my friends
			 got me into playing Basketball back in the Phillipines. But when I moved to 
			 America that's when I really got into Basketball. I played Basketball in all 
			 my middle school years. Whenever I have time to spare and when it's possible,
			 I play Basketball. </p>
			 
			 <h2> Drawing </h2>
			 <p class="serif">I have been drawing since I was a little kid. I always draw whenever I'm bored, wether it's at			 
			 school or at home. I remember use to being known to be the best drawer back in my middle school.
			 My older sister also loves to draw and she draw much better than I do. If playing Basketball is not
			 possible then drawing would be my second choice.
			 
			 <h2> Listening to Music </h2>
			 <p class="serif>I have never heard anybody say they hate Music, I think that's because everybody
			 loves Music. Whenever I want to relax or just to escape from the reality, I listen 
			 my music. I mostly listen to Hip Hop songs. My favorite rap artists are 2PAC, Eminem, and Drake.
			 Music will always be my escape.
